                <p>Virtual reality, or VR, was introduced several years ago, but until
                    At the moment, the industry has not been accommodated. This due to the high prices of their lenses,
                    or because the applications do not convince everyone.
                    Of course, this technology is really useful and entertaining, which is why it has companies
                    gigantic betting on it. Now, a new alliance has just been formed that we forecast
                    the creation of the best Virtual Reality lens to date; and in the case of HP, Valve and
                    Microsoft, we do believe them.

                    The term "virtual reality" was invented in the 1980s, but the vision of a world
                    Simulated immersion has been a part of science fiction for decades.
                    (Steven Spielberg's recent film Ready Player One offers a modern interpretation.)
                    The military carried out some of the first experiments in the 1960s and 1970s.
                    That's when engineer Tom Furness, looking for ways to help fighter pilots
                    mastering the complicated controls of aircraft, he began to work on what eventually became
                    would turn into a surprisingly realistic airplane simulator: the Super Cockpit. Boasted of images
                    Computer-generated 3D projected inside the pilot's helmet, including with sound effects.
                    "From the beginning I knew how powerful it could be," says Furness, who has been recognized as a pioneer
                    of the RV and is currently 75 years old.

                    At present, the teams are much better. Among the most expensive, scopes made by
                    Oculus, HTC and Samsung are relatively comfortable and large enough to be used with
                    prescription glasses; the best include additional focusing features to help
                    nearsighted or farsighted users.
